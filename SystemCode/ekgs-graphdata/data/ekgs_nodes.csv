? Invoice Accuracy ? The tolerance for accepting differences between the balance of two invoices is much higher than for retail. By implication checks and balances

Release and Deployment Management includes all of the processes required to package, build, test and deploy a new or changed service into the live environment.  This means that service delivery is managed across any service provider interfaces.

?Terminology?
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Release  ? eTOM Product Release, Service Release, Resource Release
ITIL Service ? eTOM CFS and RFS distinction

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Change Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
Change Management optimizes risk exposure, minimize any business disruption and to ensure that anything released into the live environment goes right the first time.  With these as the drivers Change Management should reduce risk and therefore deliver direct benefit to the business.
Change Management aims to ensure that all changes to the IT infrastructure are assessed and enacted in a controlled manner, i.e.:
Standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes
All changes to service assets and configuration items are recorded in the Configuration Management System
Overall business risk is optimized.
The goals of ITIL Change Management are to:
Respond to the customer?s changing business requirements while maximizing value and reducing incidents, disruption and re-work
Respond to the business and IT requests for change that will align the services with the business needs.
The objective of the ITIL Change Management process is to ensure that changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner.

?Terminology?
There is no specific eTOM term for changes or associated ITIL terms such as change request, change record, or change advisory board.  Instead, eTOM generically refers to ?changes? in various processes.  ITIL terminology includes: 
ITIL Change ? The actual change that is proposed and possibly carried out is conceptually referred to as an ITIL Change.  This is the generic term, which may refer to the ITIL Change Request, ITIL Change Record, the change that is carried out, or all three.
ITIL Change Request ? All changes are submitted as an ITIL Change Request, which may also be called an ITIL Request for Change. 
ITIL Change Record ? After an ITIL Change Request is submitted and accepted, all documentation related to that ITIL Change Request is captured in an ITIL Change Record. ? ITIL Change Advisory Board ? A team that meets to assess an ITIL Change Request and recommend its authorization or rejection.? ITIL Change Authority ? The individual or team that has the power to enact or reject an ITIL Change Request.  ? ITIL Standard Change ? A well-known type of change for which a simple, straightforward procedure can be carried out to enact the change. These changes are often expedited and do not require explicit authorization.  For example, a request to add a user to a security group may be an ITIL Standard Change.  It may also be called an ITIL Pre-approved Change.

In the information and communications technology (ICT) service provider domain, Security Management is a systematic and continuous series of processes and behaviors which assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Enterprise?s critical ICT assets. For ICT service providers, such assets can also include customer and partner data and resources.  Effective Security Management is essential for an ICT service provider to meet its fiduciary and legal obligations, business/mission objectives, and customer expectations.

Security Management processes include:1) Prevention;  2) Monitoring ; 3) Analysis; 4) Detection 5) Incident Management.

Security management deals with enterprise exposure to loss of value or reputation through threats or security violations.  Proactive Security Management processes identify areas of threat to the enterprise (covering both internal and external sources of threat), and monitor industry trends and best practice approaches to ensure that the enterprise remains at the forefront of security management threat minimization. Areas of threat can be physical (e.g. break-ins or terrorist incident, inappropriate use of network) or logical (e.g. inappropriate access to and use of information technology). The processes support the categorization and prioritization of areas of threat. These processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and procedures to be followed and provide assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate physical infrastructure, procedures and monitoring capabilities.

This includes several key components:

1. Identification of the need for a tool or solution.  This will include the creation of business case materials needed to support the need for investment in technology to replace manual operations or enhance volumes of data being analyzed, etc.  This process will also be the origination point for requirements vetting, collecting, and aggregation into RFx issuance, and the subsequent review and scoring of responses received.
2. Deployment scope and project management of any tool or solution.  While the operator often contains an internal PMO for deployment activities/oversight, actual requirements needed by the Fraud program must be represented and ensured by the policy process. 
3. Staff preparation.  Use of technology requires training in both the use of the technology and the fraud domain itself to understand rules and processes being employed by tools.  The policy process must identify and maintain the necessary staff requirements to operate tools to the full extent of their deployed capabilities.
4. Ongoing process and rule enhancement.  Tools are subject to modifications and enhancements necessary to address constant changes within the fraud environment.  The policy process must maintain guidelines on when rules and processes may be enhanced or updated.
5. Access to fraud tools and systems.  Tools within the fraud environment have access to particularly sensitive information that require increased levels of security.  Policies must be in place to determine who is allowed access to these tools, and specifically, what actions they are allowed to perform within these fraud tools.  For example, configuration of rules for detection should be performed by appropriate staff to ensure fair yet thorough application of any given rule.  General staff within an organization should not have access to this information or configuration capability.
6. Roadmap development.  As needs of the fraud program change, tool support inevitably must also evolve.  In cases where tool capabilities do not meet the needs for growth, requirements for enhancements must be maintained within the policy process, and made available to tool developers and/or to subsequent RFx issuing.

One of the key factors relates to the experience and conduct of the internal staff.  Certain actions by internal staff could result in harm to the operator in terms of financial loss, loss of customers, or loss of sensitive internal information.  Policies need to be constructed and maintained within the operator that outline the conduct that is expected of employees, and also what is considered a breach, or violation, of that conduct.  Additionally, penalties associated with breach or violation should also be explained within these policies (e.g., prosecution, termination, etc.).  Specific policy areas to address include, but are not limited to:
 
1. Internal communications

Earlier processing and/or analysis of datasets enables not only more rapid detection of fraud, but also the subsequent ability to take meaningful action to stop fraudulent activities before (any) damage is incurred by the business.  There are 3 primary functional areas within this process to address and define:

1. Rule Processing:  During rule processing activities, information and data is passed through rules either through automated (technology-based) means or other manual processes.  Depending on the volume of data and the complexity of the rules (interdependencies, aggregated or weighted triggering, etc.), increasing levels of technology will be necessary to quickly implement rules against data and determine the results.
2. Alert Generation:  Configuration of alerts.  Alerts may be generated when certain expected conditions are not met, including missing dataset delivery, failure to act on investigation requests (escalations), etc.  Alerts may also be issued when certain conditions are exceeded, including excessive alarm quantities resulting from ?loose? rules producing false positive results.
3. Alarm Generation:  Configuration of alarms.  Alarms are typically the result of detected events or activities that are suspicious and should be investigated as possible fraud.  Alarms may be the result of single rule violations, or of multiple rule violations that contribute to weighted levels of suspicion (more complex scenario) etc.

Other functions may also include the configuration of supplementary reports for scenarios not configured through rules and alarms as listed above.

The configuration of rules, alerts, and alarms should be governed by policies as described in the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.  Additionally, the procedures that should be followed as a result of the issuance of an alert or alarm should be governed by policies as described within the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.",50,30,Good,4

Each sub process is part of a linear flow that also includes feedback into action and support processes, as described below.

1. Alarm Assessment:  As data processing triggers alarms of suspected fraud, the assessment activity is the first point at which initial triage of the alarm(s) is conducted.   During the assessment, the analyst should determine, based on business rules, the initial validity of the alarm, a priority of the alarm (based on value, affected systems, or other criteria), and the appropriate team that would need to address the alarm (e.g., billing, wholesale partner, network, etc.).
2. Alarm Investigation:  Once initial assessment has occurred, the alarm is then forwarded to an investigation activity that typically begins as an internal function.   During investigation additional data may be accessed, scope of the issue may be ascertained, and an overall understanding of the issue will need to be achieved before determining whether the issue is, in fact, fraud.  During this process initial actions may be invoked (e.g., disrupted service) to prevent further loss/risk prior to customer contact and/or fraud determination work.
3. Contact Customer:  Once internal investigations have gathered all information available, a customer contact may be necessary to understand customer intention, validity of the subscriber, etc.  This is the final process performed prior to reaching a fraud decision.  If no customer is directly involved, this step may not be necessary (e.g., Dealer Fraud, Internal Fraud).
4. Fraud Determination:  Once all information is collected from internal and external investigations, a fraud determination is made.  If the decision is that the issue is not fraud, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Fraud Actions process (1.2.3) for closure, and the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to possibly avoid recurrence of this alarm condition.  If the decision is that the issue is, in fact fraud, similar subsequent activities will occur:  First, the issue is referred to the Fraud Actions (1.2.3) process to properly handle actions to stop the fraud, initiate collections and legal actions, etc.  Second, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to hotlists, blacklists, and any refinement needed to possibly capture the issue more rapidly.
5. Recording and Reporting:  After the determination is made as fraud or not fraud, activities associated with the analysis are finally passed into recording of actions, and reporting of recoveries, time to capture and correct, and preventative actions now in process.",50,30,Good,4
1850,Process,eTom,1.7.2.3.2.3,1.7.2.3.2,PFA,Perform Fraud Actions,EnterpriseDomain,(5) eTOM Process Type,This process contains all possible actions necessary to manage an issue following determination as fraud or not fraud.,"Fraud Actions is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities to be performed based on the issue being determined as fraud or not fraud.  Each sub process is capable of being a stand-alone process (not dependent on other Actions sub processes), however more than one of these Actions may be used to help bring any given issue to appropriate closure.

1. No Action:  If an issue is determined to not be fraud, the issue is closed and archived as part of this process.  Concurrent flows to Support and Reporting have also occurred to adjust rules, etc., as a result.  No further action is required.  Note:  A feedback to the System Configuration Management process should be considered in this case, for possible alarm threshold adjustment, whitelist updates, etc.  This process path is denoted in Figure 5:  ?Overall Process?.
2. Adjust Customer Billing:  Certain fraud instances result in customers being the victim in addition to the operator.  In these cases, extent of customer damage needs to be quickly ascertained and corrected in the customer?s billing and/or services.  While the determination of the damage is typically performed by the fraud team, the actual Customer Billing corrective action is usually performed by a Customer Care Team, based on information forwarded by the Fraud Team.
3. Legal or LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Action:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and significant financial loss, contract breach, or other illegal activities have occurred, the operator may seek recourse via the legal system.  This may be via civil reparations and/or criminal charges.  This sub process will utilize the operator?s policies (1.1.5) to determine whether attorney, law enforcement, or other assistance is needed.  This sub process will also use the same policies to determine and collect supporting information that will be necessary for those external agencies to properly pursue their activities.
4. Terminate Customer:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and the operator deems the issue to be of enough magnitude to warrant termination, this process will conduct the termination of the customer (e.g., initiate the disconnect order).
5. Dismiss Staff:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and/or a substantial violation of internal operator policies and internal staff have been found responsible, termination of the staff may be initiated at this step.  Fraud team findings for ethics policy violations, fraud investigative results, etc., should be forwarded to Human Resources, where appropriate actions will be initiated.  Of important note:  Staff negligence resulting in fraud is sometimes inappropriately diagnosed as intentional when, in fact, accidental actions may have exposed the operator to the fraud.  Care should be taken to fully understand the circumstances around which the internal employee?s actions caused or help cause the fraud.  
6. Process Change:  If an issue is determined to be fraud, future preventative steps may include business process change in addition to fraud detection rule enhancements.  Business process may have, in fact, allowed the fraud to occur, therefore the first step in prevention should happen well before a rule should capture the condition.  This process will need to interface with the business to identify candidates for process change and present those to the appropriate business stakeholders.",50,30,Good,4

Intelligence gathering processes and methods serve as one of the operator?s first lines of defense to fraud attacks, and are a critical path to understanding threats currently outside the operator?s business.  Four sub processes comprise Intelligence Gathering:

1. External Sources:  Intelligence about fraud attacks, methods to detect, methods to correct, and possible legality issues are collected and managed within this process step.  Sources may include:
a. Other operators:  Collective information about fraud attacks is frequently shared between operators as a best practice to help protect everyone
b. LEAs:  Law Enforcement Agencies ? where information about legality of the threats, punishment available by law, methods to detect, etc., may be obtained
c. Industry support bodies:  Fraud protection forums including TM Forum, GSM Fraud Forum, CFCA, FIINA; Credit bureaus
d. Other industries:  General utilities, healthcare, insurers, etc., where identity theft practices and other frauds also occur
2. Customer Behavior Analysis:  By understanding behaviors that lead to fraud activity, patterns associated with these behaviors can be identified and isolated.  Once isolated, patterns of activities across all customers may be monitored for similar patterning that would lead to alarms and analysis much earlier in an attempted fraud activity.
3. Customer Contacts:  Frequently fraud activities conducted by an individual or syndicate (defined for this instance as an organized group) will also involve other parties that may not be directly associated with the fraud, but are knowledgeable of the activity.  While the individual(s) initiating the fraud may be isolated and the attack halted, care should be taken to understand the associated parties within the communications patterns of the initiating fraudsters.  Attacks may resume via these individuals, and therefore close monitoring of this chain of parties is warranted.  Note that none of these individuals (that either started the attack or were part of the communications patterns) may be direct customers of the targeted operator.
4. Whistleblower:  A ?Whistleblower? is defined as an individual that identifies fraud activity to an operator.  This individual is most often an internal employee (revealing internal fraud activity), but may also be an external party otherwise unaffiliated with the operator.  Several operators have encouraged internal whistle blowing by offering incentives as part of normal operator policy to reward those people that bring fraud attacks to the attention of the fraud management team.",50,30,Good,4

Within this process several protective steps are taken to ensure risk to the business is mitigated as much as possible as an ongoing practice.  Three sub processes comprise the carrier?s ability to reduce and avoid threats:

1. Propagate Black Lists:  As fraud attacks are identified and confirmed, those individual(s) and any aliases are collected and managed within black lists.  These lists should be used as a tool to protect the operator against re-issue of services to those on the list.  Understanding that the list will be in a constant state of growth over time, an operator will undoubtedly encounter a black listed name belonging to a completely unassociated and innocent individual.  Consequently, operators should consider investigation of those cases prior to denial of services, in hopes of not excluding legitimate, non-fraud customers.
2. Staff Vetting:  Operators should conduct thorough background and security checks on individuals that will have access to sensitive and otherwise vulnerable areas within the operator?s business (access to network systems, billing systems, customer records and accounts, financial data, etc.).  Internal fraud is a substantial threat to every operator, and depending on the employee?s area of access, periodic re-checks of backgrounds of existing employees is not unreasonable.
3. Customer Education:  Certain fraud types are often unable to be blocked by operators, and may victimize an operator?s customer base while also causing loss to the operator (e.g., customer credits given).  In these situations, proactive steps should be initiated by the operator to educate their customer base on behavioral changes and/or methods that will help to prevent these fraud types from occurring.  This may be in the form of press releases, PSAs (Public Service Announcements), and even direct customer contacts.
4. Risk Reviews:  Risk Reviews are conducted throughout the business on recurring, non-standard intervals.  Risk reviews should focus on threats and vulnerabilities across (at least) the following targets within the operator?s business:
a. Current operations and processes
b. Proposed new operational processes
c. Current products
d. Proposed new products
e. New systems within the network

This process must remained tightly interfaced with the fraud analysis and determination activities to ensure lists are maintained as current, and that rules are properly deployed and utilized.  Three primary sub processes are driven within System Configuration Management:

1. Hot Lists:  Hot lists contain patterns of activity and behavior of past fraudsters.  These patterns may be analyzed against current patterns of activities within the network to detect re-emergence of fraud activity.
2. Black Lists:  These list(s) contain names/identities of prior known fraudsters, and should be continually checked against new subscribers.  This should also include altered identities through a variety of methods.
3. Rules Library and Configurations:  All rules associated with fraud detection are maintained within this sub process.  The challenge facing operators with rules management goes beyond the simple configuration of rules; an operator must also continue to review rule performance (ability to capture fraud, sensitivity to capture fraud vs. creating ?false positive? alerting, etc.).  Additionally, rules are constantly changing and growing based on changing dynamics in networks, products, systems, internal processes, subscriber base, etc. 
4. Alarm threshold management:  Based on results of Fraud Determination (within process identifier 1.2.2), threshold adjustments will need to made to either correct for ?false positive? alarming, or to increase threshold sensitivity to detect additional suspected fraud situations.

IT Service Continuity Management operates in support of overall Business Continuity Management within the enterprise to ensure that the IT systems and support are available within the business, and to recover and restore IT service as required and agreed when service interruptions arise. The IT Service Continuity Manager will carry out a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for all existing and new services and will then ensure that the results are included within the IT Service Continuity Plan which will be aligned to the Business Continuity Plan.  This process is also responsible for carrying out risk assessments to ensure that these risks can be mitigated to prevent a disaster situation if it is justifiable to do so.

?Terminology?
The use of ?Service? in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise?s customers) will map to Product. ITIL IT Services represent a subset of the services recognized within ITIL, which also identifies Business Services that these IT Services support and contribute to.

Information Security Management addresses the safety and integrity of information within the enterprise, and aims to satisfy a Service Level Agreement that has been established with the owners/users of the information concerning these aspects. Issues involved include the availability of the information, and maintaining its integrity and confidentiality as required and agreed. More generally, Information Security Management relates to IT Service Continuity Management, since information security will form part of the overall approach for IT service continuity. The Information Security Manager is responsible for developing and managing the Security Policies and also ensuring that they are enforced.  They will work closely with the IT Service Continuity Manager carrying out BIA and ensuring that the security aspects are considered appropriately.

ITIL Problem Management is driving to find the root cause of a problem.  This is not about fixing something quickly but about ensuring that the fix is permanent once it is implemented.  The Problem Manager will maintain information on problems, fixes and workarounds and links in very closely with Knowledge Management processes.

?Terminology?
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, each problem is qualified according to its layer of origin. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as a Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.
From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.
In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and  ITIL Service Request.
ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.
ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported. These are managed within this process.
ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.

Service Asset and Configuration Management identifies, controls, records, reports and verifies the service assets and Configuration Items (CIs) in order to support the business and customer?s control objectives and requirements.  The key point within this area is that it considers all Service Assets and not just hardware and software.
Service Asset and Configuration Management aims to:
? Identify, control, record, report, audit and verify service assets and configuration items, including versions, baselines, constituent components, their attributes, and relationships
? Account for, manage and protect the integrity of service assets and configuration items (and, where appropriate, those of its customers) through the service lifecycle by ensuring that only authorized components are used and only authorized changes are made
? Protect the integrity of service assets and configuration items (and, where appropriate, those of its customers) through the service lifecycle
? Ensure the integrity of the assets and configurations required to control the services and IT infrastructure by establishing and maintaining an accurate and complete Configuration Management System.

The goals of Configuration Management are to:
? Support the business and customer?s control objectives and requirements
? Support efficient and effective Service Management processes by providing accurate configuration information to enable people to make decisions at the right time, e.g. to authorize change and releases, resolve incidents and problems faster. 
? Minimize the number of quality and compliance issues caused by improper configuration of services and assets
? Optimize the service assets, IT configurations, capabilities and resources.

The objective is to define and control the components of services and infrastructure and maintain accurate configuration information on the historical, planned and current state of the services and infrastructure.

Event Management aims to detect IT infrastructure events and determine the appropriate response to them.  Not all events require a response, but some do. Some responses may be automated, although some may require manual intervention. Event Management provides the ability to detect events, to make sense of them and to determine the most suitable control activity.  This depends on monitoring but should not be considered as just that, monitoring provides information on everything, event management provides meaningful information and notifications. 

?Terminology?
Both ITIL and eTOM use the term ?event? in similar ways.  However, the term ?event? needs to be used in other areas where ITIL Event Management can be integrated, including those listed in the following section.  In addition, eTOM uses the terms ?problem? and ?trouble? to refer to many things, including events.  This is a source of potential confusion, so the distinctions between ITIL and eTOM usage in this area should be kept in mind.

All operational services and those being prepared for operation are recorded within the Service Catalogue by the Service Catalogue Manager.  This information must be accurate and kept up to date.

?Terminology?
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each takes of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Service ? compared with SID Resource Facing Service and Customer Facing Service, ITIL Service is defined as services serving one business unit, multiple business units or business external to the enterprise; by convention we should identify the first two as RFS and the latter as CFS.

Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.

From the eTOM perspective, each incident is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, an incident created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Incident, etc. (Similarly, this qualification by layer is applied to the identification of the underlying problem. For example, a Problem identified in the Service Management layer may be initially described as an Service Problem. However, it may be subsequently described as a Resource Problem following root cause determination.)From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM. Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.

In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.
ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.
ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.
ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc. For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are better handled by a separate process, the ITIL Request Fulfilment process. In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Availability Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
The Availability Manager is responsible for ensuring the current Service is performing to its availability targets as well as ensuring that new services are designed to deliver the availability levels required by the business.  The Availability Manager will help to specify what the reliability, maintainability and serviceability of a new service should be.

?Terminology?
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.

Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Request Fulfillment (or equivalent) may apply in such cases.
ITIL Request Fulfillment ensures that Service Requests are fulfilled in a controlled and timely manner, most of these service requests are actually changes to the service but due to the small scale impact and frequency it makes sense to take them out of the change management process.  The models used for request fulfillment must be signed off by change management before they are used to ensure that there are no risks to the service or environment by implementing them.

?Terminology?
Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used.
Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns.

Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses.
From the eTOM perspective, each service request is qualified according to its layer of origin. So, for example, a service request created in the customer layer may be described as a Customer Service Request  etc. In addition, service requests are not constrained to the Fulfillment vertical in the Operations part of eTOM. They can also be found in other verticals such as problem handling in the assurance vertical or bill inquiry handling in the billing vertical.
From the ITIL perspective, a single end-to-end activity is envisaged that does not necessitate the creation of complementary objects in other layers as occurs in eTOM.
Now, turning to the terms used by each approach.
In the ITIL approach, it is necessary to distinguish 3 terms. ITIL Incident, ITIL Problem and ITIL Service Request.
ITIL Incident. An unplanned interruption to an IT service or reduction in the quality of an IT service. The failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service is also an ITIL incident, for example the failure of one disk from a mirror set.
ITIL Problem. An ITIL Problem is the underlying cause of one or more ITIL incidents and remains a separate entity. An ITIL Problem must be solved to prevent the ITIL incident from recurring. ITIL Incident Management forms part of the overall process of dealing with problems in the organization and provides a point where these are reported.
ITIL Service Request. Used as a generic description for many varying types of demands that are placed upon the IT Department by the users. Many of these are actually small changes  .. low risk, frequently occurring, low cost, etc.
For example, a request (to change a password, to install an additional software application onto a particular workstation, to relocate some items of desktop equipment) or maybe just a question requesting information. The scale and frequent, low-risk nature of these ITIL Service Requests means that they are handled in this process.
In the eTOM approach, the eTOM is updated to adopt the ITIL terms for incidents and problems and to include explicit reference to these, whether in an IT or business context.

Continual Service Improvement represents pro-active mechanisms to help an organization to improve and realize benefits in terms of ROI (return on investment) and VOI (value on investment) along with intangible benefits of customer and staff satisfaction increasing. Note that while there may be a central focus for CSI within an organization, typically the activities to improve should form part of everyone?s roles.  Everyone within the organization needs to be empowered to suggest improvement ideas and those who actually run the processes or areas of business affected by an Improvement activity should be expected to implement the solutions.

?Terminology?
The use of ?Service? in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterprise?s customers) will map to Product.

These applications interact to provide fully automated service or assisted service over various customers touch points. Although customer self management applications primarily trigger functionality defined in the rest of the CRM, Service Management and Resource Management applications, they should also contain functionality specific to customer self empowerment. As service providers shift to multidimensional services, new business realities require self service systems to support the following criteria:
? One-and-done fulfillment across service portfolio (cf. Order Management Applications) 
? Multi-disciplinary customer service (cf. Customer Service / Account Problem resolution applications) 
? Sync multi-channel interoperability 
? Total convergent self directed billing (view/pay/dispute all) (cf. Front Office Customer Billing Management applications) 
? Reconciliation interoperability 
? Personalization and usability 
? Visualization of SLAs across subscribed services (cf. Customer Service / Account Problem resolution applications) 
? Portfolio driven guided selling (cf. Product Catalogue, Product Lifecycle Management applications) 
? Leveraging the 360 degree customer view (cf. Customer Information Management Application) 

Customer self management applications enable service providers to increase profitability across the organization by optimizing the customer experience and maximizing the efficiency of business operations through:
? Rapid order-to-activation mechanism across service portfolio
? Commodity like enablement for telecom services (rapid introduction& easy amendment& cross bundling) 
? Universal platform supporting multiple users (consumers& business& dealers) and multiple LOBs (wire line& wireless& IPTV) though single point of contact 
? Reducing costs through operating efficiencies 

These operations expect to gain more customer loyalty, service stickiness and ARPU for the service provider. A primary factor for increasing ARPU through self empowered systems is high usability. High usability requires channel agnostic consistency and seamless customer experience leveraging functionality that is driven from sporadic backend systems. For that, self empowered systems should provide integration readiness through several vehicles:

?  Pre-integrated self service system including stand-alone web framework or integration front end with a portal engine 
?  Self services layer exposing atomic Webservices/APIs for reuse by multiple systems across the architectural environment 
?  Portlets driven connectivity exposing data and services interoperability through a portal engine or web application. 

Typically the portal to the customer is via a web-based interface. Customer self care is increasingly popular with both customers and operators as it usually provides access to information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and does not have the frustration of waiting for a free call agent. Customer self-care systems can take a number of forms from a controlled ?secure window? application into the underlying OSS systems used internally by the operator for the customer to view and pay his invoices to a complete portal where the customer can manage his entire relationship with the operator. Customer Self Management applications need to provide a level of security to protect both the customer?s data and the integrity of the underlying systems. They should also be capable of providing single sign on capabilities to access Business and Operational Support Systems.",200,10,Good,8

A Service Inventory application may store and manage any or all of the following entities:
? Customer facing service (CFS) instances, and their attributes
? Resource facing service (RFS) instances, and their attributes
The Service Inventory may also store and manage service relationships:
? The mapping of services (RFSes or CFSes) to other services and/or service components, the components being either:
? Other child services
? Resources and the resource domain managers used to implement the service, or 
? Services and resources in Supplier/Partner systems used to implement the service 
This mapping is stored either intrinsically in the core Service Inventory, or discretely via Service-Supporting Resource Inventory applications.
Service Inventory may include the following relationship types between entity instances:
?         Realization by Composition ? A mapping from a service to the child services and/or resources which specifically compose that service (e.g. the RFS instance or instances whose whole purpose is to implement a CFS, the assignable resources which realize an RFS). If a parent service is torn down, child objects with a Composition relationship are typically removed or reallocated (e.g. transitioned to spares inventory).
?         Realization by Aggregation ? A mapping from a service to the services and/or resources which support this service in addition to other services. (e.g. a network access RFS which supports a number of different network CFSes). If a parent service is torn down, child objects with an Aggregation relationship are typically maintained as long as at least one other parent service still exists.
?         Dependency ? A link between services and/or resources which is not strong enough to qualify as Composition or Aggregation, but where various Fulfillment, Assurance, and Change Management processes need to be aware of the relationship.

Service-Resource Inventory entails managing the relationship between RFSes and the resources and resource domain managers which implement the services on the network. Resources may all be directly managed by the carrier's Resource Inventory systems, or may also include references to resources from a Supplier/Partner asset management system.
Typically, this inventory does not track all possible network resources involved in delivery of the service (this is the realm of Resource Inventory Management systems themselves), but rather:
? Any stand-alone physical or logical resources whose assignment is critical to service fulfilment, and whose tracking is critical to service operations, assurance, and billing. Examples may include: modem or other special CPE equipment which may not be tracked directly as part of the provider network, static IP addresses and other network identifiers, etc.
? Assignment-level resources which represent a larger resource structure supporting the service, often referred to as an Access Point. Examples include: the ADSL DSLAM port assigned to a service, a data circuit service assigned customer facing router interface or subinterface, etc.

When new service inventory information is discovered, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will try to match the newly discovered information with an entity or entities already existing in the Service Inventory.

If no match is found, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will typically assume that a new entity has been discovered and add the entity to the inventory. Alternately, as decided by the service provider as part of their procedures, the Service Inventory Reconciliation system may record this event as an exception, implicitly or explicitly triggering a workflow to resolve the exception. For example, this may happen if the service provider always expects to have the planned service inventory in their Service Inventory Management systems before the actual services are activated.

If a match is found and there are no unexpected discrepancies, the Service Inventory Reconciliation / Synchronization system will update the inventory as needed. For example, records may be updated to fill in missing attributes or update attribute values which have changed.

EAI technology allows this integration to be done using techniques that leverage the architecture. Using these concepts, applications send or receive events / messages to or from other components or send or receive notifications. Such architecture provides greater degrees of freedom. For example, components can be replaced by new ones more easily as they have the same interface. It is also easier to plug-in a new component that will use the services already available. EAI includes:
? transport of data between applications
? data format translations
? implementation, at EAI level, of enhanced enterprise level objects
The following are two example solutions that can be found in the EAI sub-domain:
?         Managed File Transfer, referring to software for moving data, overcoming the limitations found in conventional FTP (e.g. support to multiple protocols, automation, security, auditability, monitoring, etc.).   
?         Cache and Distributed Caching, which goals are to provide performance and scalability to applications.
In the following sections, we start with a description of the analysis methodology and guidelines that are used in this section for the EA Integration of the focused applications. Use of this analysis methodology should reduce making inappropriate decisions based on expected capabilities associated with such architectures.
It must also be noted that Enterprise Integration is generally implemented in a number of successive phases. This is particularly true when few existing applications are already efficiently integrated together. It is recommended that the first phases usually consist in the integration of new features and new applications and that in further phases it can be envisaged to enhance the integration of the existing applications.",200,10,Good,8
2485,Technology,TAM,10.2,10,BPM&W,Business Process Management & Workflow,IntegrationDomain,(1) TAM Application Type,Business Process Management & Workflow,"Business Process Management (BPM) is the evolution of earlier concepts called workflow management (also known as Process Flow Management). As operators understand the need to introduce much greater flexibility and day-day change into their business processes, BPM and workflow management techniques, pioneered in manufacturing industry, are becoming more and more visible in the communications industry. 
Business flexibility is crucial for an operator as well as high levels of automation of its processes, not just of basic process flows but of complex and exception handling areas. One of the cardinal principles of Frameworx is to allow this by abstraction of business processes from application logic. The emergence of N-tier computing and component-oriented environments (such as COM and J2EE) allow for this principle in the same manner that the emergence of SQL and the two-tier client/server architecture enabled the abstraction of data management from application code. By separating business process management as an independent function, applications can be designed around existing processes, and thus to take advantage of shared business logic rather than reinventing and recoding it for each application.There are considerable benefits to an operator in adopting this type of approach and would include:Reduced costsStaff savingsCash flow improvementBetter customer perceptionFaster and more flexible response to implement new processes or amend existing ones to accommodate new products / servicesTo understand how BPM fits with an operator and its infrastructure, it is helpful to examine the individual components of BPM. While commercial implementations vary in their specific definitions and software composition, most fit within the basic framework described below. Note that although some systems offer the ability to automate activities and define business rules, those that lack the fundamental components below cannot realistically be used as a BPM system.A BPM system is defined by the components of:Execution EngineProcess Designer,Process DefinitionsActivity MonitorUser interface which may be a combination of a Windows client application, HTML based Work Portal, or an exposed API or Web serviceThe majority of BPM systems on the market today are component-oriented and allow each of the individual pieces listed above to be deployed independently on individual servers. Individual business processes are defined by the process owner in a Process Definition, (increasingly expressed in a standard language such as UML or some variation of XML). Each Process Definition may be composed of both manual activities and automated activities. Once defined and validated within the Process Designer, processes are instantiated by an Execution Engine. The Activity Monitor provides access to status and performance metrics on the execution of processes. End-to-end process ?orchestration?It is unlikely that the implementation of a Frameworx based ?lean? migration program will be a ?big bang? type of approach implementing all new systems. Therefore, the Enterprise Integration Framework will need to integrate end-to-end processes across various ?islands of automation? ranging from existing legacy systems to new commercial-off-the-shelf technology. This approach is sometimes called ?orchestration? in process. An orchestration-based approach offers the ability to manage processes of greater complexity, (such as complex business service provisioning etc.) with far more efficiency than is otherwise possible with alternative approaches. The key to this is a modular approach to managing business rules, relationships, and activities.Within a simple workflow automation paradigm, processes are defined ?end-to-end? with all possible paths (or more commonly a single path) pre-determined. Thus ?Step 5? always follows ?Step 4? and precedes ?Step 6? even if different instances of an otherwise standard process may require a different sequence.Orchestration allows for the sequencing of steps to be determined during the ?run-time? instance of a process, with paths determined by evolving context resulting from each new step. Thus the potential number of paths and outcomes may otherwise be too complex to define in terms of pre-determined ?If-Then-Else? rules, but may be easily resolved through human interaction and decision-making. This highlights the key architectural difference between automation and orchestration. Given the inherent complexity and constant changes within an operator?s business environment, effectively managing processes requires the agility to shift with changes in context, rather than always being bound to the same scripted flow. This requires the unique ability to define processes as a set of atomic, goal-based activities with the enforcement of basic parameters (e.g., time limits, data variables), while separating the execution logic activities from the higher-level process definition. Process orchestration is not limited to invoking software, but rather represents a shift from task-based to goal-oriented process definition. Web services and other forms of software automation are utilized through process orchestration, yet not to the exclusion of manual, human-driven activities.",200,10,Good,8

High-performance, scalable, and low latency engine capable of mediatingHTTPrequests betweenAPI consumers and service enablers;

Cache: Although completely optional to use, many times it is desirable or required to configure caching at the broker level for specific service enabler operation responses. By caching those responses, the broker can improve its responsiveness by reducing the number of requests to an underlying service enabler to whenever its responses are not already cached.
Mediation of high throughput ofHTTPrequests betweenAPIconsumers and services;
Awareness and support of Web protocols semantics (MIMEtypes,HTTPAuthorization and Caching headers, etc.);

Header transform: modifications of header names and/or header information (e.g., service enabler-specific header to IANA-based header)
Support of Data Format, Data Model transformations and Protocol Bridging between most or all common Web standards (WS-*,SOAP,XML, REST, JSON, etc.);

Parameter transform: modifications of parameter names and/or parameter values
Method transform: modifications of the method specified in API request (e.g., POST to DELETE)
Error information transform: modifications of error information in the body part of API response
Status code transform: modifications of status code in the API response (e.g., 302 ?Found? to 303 ?See Other?)
Information masking: filtering some information in the API response based on query parameters in API request or based on API provider?s policy
Abstraction: conceptually transformations of the meanings of parameters or decrease of the number of request parameters
Protocol transform: transformations of protocol to send API requests/responses (e.g., SOAP to REST)
Mash-up (Composition): assembling a new API with existing APIs provided by service enabler.
Content-based routing, fail-over, load balancing, and broadcasting of requests;

Route: The broker Route task is the most commonly used task in a broker. A service enabler consumer issues a request to a given service; the broker Route task is responsible for forwarding that request to its underlying service enabler. Beyond the basic behavior of routing, the Route task should allow the parameterization of request timeout, HTTP keep alive connection, HTTP basic or digest authentication, URL decode, HTTP X-Forwarded-For/Host/Server, HTTP referrer, exception shielding configuration, HTTP status code, content based routing by regular expressions or xPath, etc. 
Support of standard authentication and authorization protocols (WS-Federation, SAML, OAuth, etc.), for both internal and external applications,APIdevelopers and users;
Validate: The broker Validate task ensures that only valid messages (according to their contract?s schema) are routed to the remote host. This capability lowers dramatically the number of malformed messages that are presented to a given service enabler, and by doing so contributes to maximize the performance and scalability of that service enabler.
Policy, Charging ; Rules Function: The Broker decision task makes it possible to have decision trees within a workflow or policy evaluation, at any nesting level. This is the basis for many possible micro-workflow related activities, making possible to configure a decision point structure where multiple option are present. The values tested in those options can be static or dynamically retrieved at runtime from the broker runtime context or from any part of the currently processed message.
Diagnose: The Broker Diagnose task dynamically updates underlying management systems such as the Windows Management Instrumentation performance counters so that they can be monitored and reported upon by the monitoring service.
Log: The broker Log task enables the logging of any request or response at any time during the processing of a strategy. The task should be able to execute synchronously or asynchronously, and target a designated file system path, database server, HTTP URL, or email address. If configurable to run only for a specific request or response message of a specific user (or user role) the task can be targeted to a specific operation of a specific service enabler. These granularities together with the possibility to deliver the log information in different channels offer great flexibility for both operation and debug scenarios. 

CDR: creation of Call Detail Record for calculating API usage fee. 
Traffic Control: The broker limits the access from the valid service consumers based on the contract with service consumers or service enablers or based on the conditions of API broker itself or service enablers.

Flow control (Inbound): access limitations based on the contract between API provider and application developers (e.g., throughput/quota/concurrent connections limit)
Flow control (Outbound): access limitation based on the contract between API provider and service enablers or the conditions of service enablers (e.g., throughput/quota/concurrent connections limit)
Application Management: managing account information for recognizing applications (e.g., API key/OAuth2.0?s client_id, client_secret) and application developers. 
Data Encryption Key Management: managing data encryption keys to encrypt data in a case of sending sensitive data through API.
Market or Store: In order to accomplish the task of commercial or business mediation, the Broker can implement for itself or communicate to some other external marketplace / store service. For example the broker should be able to count and track requests for any given request or response, and optionally cause the broker to refuse serving any more requests for a specific user if a configured request limit per service consumer or if a configured time frame is reached.
Protect: The broker Protect task may impose access restrictions to some service consumers, in order to protect service enablers from abuse or undesired usage. Some common examples are the configuration of an IP address range restriction or a limit to the maximum message size accepted.
